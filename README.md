 # About

A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all, the most important factor for such a company is to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand. Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks — and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors.

The replenishment of majority of raw materials is done on weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, the procurement planning is of utmost importance.

It has been a challenging task to manage perishable food supply chains because of the perishable product’s short lifetime, the possible spoilage of the product due to its deterioration nature, and the retail demand uncertainty. All of these factors can lead to a significant amount of shortage of food items and a substantial retail loss. The mass spoilage and difficulty in management impel retailers to set a higher retail price, which retains the consumption and results in frequent shortages.

This task could be solved using the Light Gradient Boost framework classifier and predict the food demand based on the previous data.
